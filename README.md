### Italian Lottery Game

This project simulates the "Lotto," the Italian Lottery Game, which involves tickets and number extractions.

Each ticket consists of a selection of numbers (minimum 1, maximum 10), a choice of 'ruote', the combination to play, and the amount to bet. The numbers available for selection range from 1 to 90 inclusive, and the same number cannot be chosen more than once on each ticket.

Specifically, the 'ruote' include:

- Bari
- Cagliari
- Firenze
- Genova
- Milano
- Napoli
- Palermo
- Roma
- Torino
- Venezia

The combinations are:

- **Ambata**: guess one extracted number
- **Ambo**: guess two extracted numbers
- **Terno**: guess three extracted numbers
- **Quaterna**: guess four extracted numbers
- **Cinquina**: guess five extracted numbers

The Extraction process involves drawing 5 random numbers from 1 to 90 for each of the 10 'ruote'. To win, the numbers on your ticket must match the extracted numbers based on the 'ruota' and combination you have bet on.

### How to Play
